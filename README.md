## [Titanic Machine Learning](https://github.com/jihanfarah/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic.ipynb)

This project is a challenge from Kaggle. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. In this challenge, I build a predictive model using feature engineering based on DQLab's project that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive in Titanic sink?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

## [SQL Data Exploration COVID-19](https://github.com/jihanfarah/SQLDataExploration)

This project is based on [Alex Freberg's SQL Data Exploration Tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&feature=youtu.be). I use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to do this project and get the dataset from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The main purpose of this project is to explore the dataset to get some information about COVID-19 cases.
